 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

My project is based off of Puddingway from ff14. The goal of the game is to collect Carrots and Pudding before reaching the goal. I used elements from Roll-a-ball, apple picker, and mission demolition to make this game. There are pickup objects and obstacles that move left to right for added difficulty. Once players reach the end they replay the game to try to get a higher score by collecting all the pickup items.
